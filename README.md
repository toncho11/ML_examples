# ML Examples

This is a repository for Machine Learning/Data Science code samples.

It includes the following algorithms, frameworks or subdomains of ML/DS:

  * Keras and PyTorch for Deep Learning (CNN)
  * Transformers for Chat Bots and for Image Classfication/Object Detection (Hugging Face, OpenAI)
  * Transfer Learning with PyTorch for Image Classification
  * EEG ERP Classification
  * Decision Trees
  * Statistical Hypothesis Testing
  * A/B Testing
  * Autoencoders
  * Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)

Famous datasets (exploration / classification):
  * Open Food Facts (OFF)

The idea is to download an example quickly, be able to run it right away, go through the comments and links, modify it for your own needs and have a [POC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof_of_concept) prototype in less than 15 minutes.
