A bot with OpenAI that uses a selective history in order to avoid sending all the previous
interactions to OpenAI.

All interactions are stored into segments. For each segment, the function computes the cosine similarity between
the user's input and the segment using the cos_sim function. The cosine similarity measures the similarity between
two vectors. Only the relevant segments are sent to OpenAI as a context.
